#### Exercise 1

The secret message is "Fuzz2017".

My fuzzer is written in python 2. The source file for my fuzzer is named *tan-a0127051-lab8-ex1.py* and the instructions to run my fuzzer can be found in *README.txt*.

My fuzzer takes an argument which is the binary and outputs the secret message and all the arguments which give the secret message. Every line in the output of my fuzzer has the following format:
```
arg1 arg2 secret_message
```
#### Exercise 2

The formula is
```
arg1 = 20 + 30x + z
arg2 = 50 + 60y + z

where x, y and z are integers and 0 <= x <= 7, 0 <= y <= 3 and 0 <= z <= 9  
```
